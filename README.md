# weather-app v2

When I was learning web development years ago, and following [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), I built https://github.com/sharpar/weatherapp for the [weather app project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-weather-app-a3cec42b11fa/). (Don't check it out, the demo doesn't work anymore :cry:)

Since then, I've learnt a lot, so for a fun exercise and to refresh some React skills and techniques, I built the second iteration! I'll be using this app as a playground of sorts to try new things.

Demo: http://three-city-weather.netlify.app/

- Front End: React 
- Weather API: Dark Sky 
- Icons: https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons

See you in 2025 for weather-app v3.
